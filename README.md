# Rock-paper-scissors
## Milestone 1
- Environment for the project is set by getting known with the different terminal commands and building the python environment.
## Milestone 2

- In this I had created 4 different class in the image model and they are Rock, Paper, Scissors, Nothing. 
- In each class there is bunch of images for different class to feed the model. As many as image the model has the model will be that much accurate.
- After creating classes the model has been trained and the file of that is been downloaded.
